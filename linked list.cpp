//Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students 

//of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. 

//Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of 

//club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club 

//memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write 

//functions to:

//a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.

//b) Compute total number of members of club

//c) Display members

//d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists
